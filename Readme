In this project, we explore audio classification techniques with a vehicular noise dataset to identify time-critical emergency vehicles approaching potential areas 
of congestion, like junctions, to ease the congestion.
The objective of this project is to build a model that will be able to distinguish between the sound of the sirens, the emergency vehicles, and the sound generated 
by the other vehicles.
This project follows two main techniques, them being time domain analysis and frequency domain analysis. The classification is done
using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long-short-term memory (LSTM).
